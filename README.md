> "*In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not.*" â€” Albert Einstein

In theory, the stock prices of oil companies and airline companies are negatively correlated, as oil companies generate more revenue while airlines incur more expenses with rising oil prices. In theory, gold is inversely related to equity securities, as it is seen as a safe asset in times of turmoil in the stock market. In theory, companies whose quarterly earnings beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts rise in value, while those who disappoint decline. 

In practice, financial securities in recent years are becoming increasingly correlated. Systematic risk is having a much larger effect on price action than idyosyncratic risk. More often than not, the movement of the overall market seems to influence a company's stock price more than that company's performance. In light of this, how can we dynamically identify the stocks and allocations that will create a portfolio unphased by market movements? The answer is the culmination of the lectures of Professor James Thompson, the tutorials of numerous teaching assistants, and the fruits of the dozens of hours of labour invested by four freshmen CFM students.
